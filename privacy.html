    <p>The privacy policy of Money Finance Tracking (MFT) will be as follows:  Privacy will be expected to for each individual that uses MFT unless they make a request for trouble shooting that involves reading the database under their specific account.  Each user has a seperate database that contains their accounts, transactions, and categories.  Another scenerio is if and when law enforcement has a valid warrant, data will be turned over under those terms.  Use of MFT is expermental at the moment under test.moneyfinancetracking.com.  Once I have put in the ability to reconcile accounts and add/edit categories, I will at that time open up MFT for the general public use.  Data in the database is unencrypted except for the user password which is hashed using standard php password functions.</p>
