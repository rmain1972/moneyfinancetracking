A check ledger that runs on php

This runs on an apache2 server with php installed.  To check out the live version, goto https://test.moneyfinancetracking.com.

If you want to create your own, you will need to edit mysqlnfo.php to set the master password for the MySQL database.
You will also need to create an initial database setup using create_main_db.sql and create_2ndry_db.sql.

Any other questions should be sent to rmain1972@live.com
